# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Domain of interest
As we've discussed, data science can expose underlying patterns in any domain that uses or collects data (which is nearly any domain). Anything from the forced relocation of homeless individuals (Links to an external site.) to how people gender representation (Links to an external site.) in the media, data can expose interesting (and actionable) patterns. In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:

- Why are you interested in this field/domain?
 -	Many people, including our group, may have seen violent kids that commit crimes in school and outside of school when they were adolescents. Moreover, some news was saying about the juvenile crimes that made people concern about the juvenile crime and incarceration. This provoked our group to research juvenile crime and juvenile incarceration, compare the rates of occurrence in the past to the present, and the factors that lead adolescents to these crimes.

- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
 - [Link on the the data driven project](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/library/publications/juvenile-justice-model-data-project-final-technical-report) - **not the answer, just the idea for now**

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
 - Data-driven questions that we hope to answer are:
  1. The rate of juvenile crime and incarceration

  2. What factors that lead adolescents to juvenile crimes

  3. Compare the rates of juvenile crime and incarceration by states to see which region is likely to commit juvenile crime than other region.

We strongly suggest that you complete this section first, discussing what you might want to learn, then move forward with the data discovery process.

## Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

1. Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
-	[Link on the rates by states](https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/youth-incarceration/americas-addiction-juvenile-incarceration-state-state)
- [Link on the overall rates of juvenile crime](https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/faqs.asp#3)
2. How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

3. How many observations (rows) are in your data?

4. How many features (columns) are in the data?

5. What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
