# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

## Domain of interest
As we've discussed, data science can expose underlying patterns in any domain that uses or collects data (which is nearly any domain). Anything from the forced relocation of homeless individuals (Links to an external site.) to how people gender representation (Links to an external site.) in the media, data can expose interesting (and actionable) patterns. In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:

- Why are you interested in this field/domain?

Many people, including members of our group, have noticed a growing concern about crimes committed by young adolescents and the rate of juvenile incarceration in the U.S. This provoked our group to research juvenile crime and incarceration, compare the rates of occurrence in the past to the present, and analyze the factors that lead adolescents to these crimes. We want to ask these questions about patterns in the rates of crime, where these crimes are happening, and who are committing these crimes because this type of information influences government attitudes and policy making. 

- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

[Link on the the data driven project](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/library/publications/juvenile-justice-model-data-project-final-technical-report) - **not the answer, just the idea for now**

[Juvenile Justice GPS](http://www.jjgps.org/juvenile-justice-services#risk-assessment?year=2020) is an interactive website that was created to track juvenile justice change across the country to better understand and encourage reform. This website details the variations in juvenile justice laws, policies, and procedures in each state and over time. This website presents this data alongside relevant juvenile justice statistical information in an interactive, visual way. 

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

Some data-driven questions that we hope to answer are:

1. What are the rates of juvenile crime and incarceration in the United States?

2. What are the factors that lead adolescents and juveniles to commit these crimes?

3. Which state or region of the U.S. does juvenile crime seem most prevelant?

We strongly suggest that you complete this section first, discussing what you might want to learn, then move forward with the data discovery process.

## Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

1. Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

-	[Link on the rates by states](https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/youth-incarceration/americas-addiction-juvenile-incarceration-state-state)

- [Link on the overall rates of juvenile crime](https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/faqs.asp#3)

2. How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

3. How many observations (rows) are in your data?

4. How many features (columns) are in the data?

5. What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
